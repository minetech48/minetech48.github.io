			<p> Minesweeper was a game developed by Microsoft in the 1990s, in which the player clicks on a grid of squares to
			reveal what what is behind any given tile. Most of the time, the tile will be empty, in which case, it will reveal
			all adjacent tiles. </p>
			
			<p> If a tile is adjacent to a mine, it will display a number equal to the number of mines adjacent to it.
				If the clicked tile is a mine, all tiles are revealed and the game ends.
			</p>
			<p> The player is given a flag tool
				in order to mark the tiles that they have deduced contains a mine. The goal of the game is to reveal every tile
				except for the mines.
			</p>
			<p> Importantly, an adjacent tile is defined as any tile within one unit in each grid direction
				(meaning corners are included)
			</p>
			
			<p> Now for my small project, some time in 2018 I suddenly got the idea to nest arrays in order to create a
				structure that can define/contain an arbitrary number of dimensions, rather than just the normal 2.

			Figure 1 is a 30x10x10x10x10 board, coordinates in the top right represent the location of the top-left tile,
			as rendering a 5D plane is not possible. The user can use keybinds [; ‘ , .] to navigate the planes.
			On this particular board, being 5 dimensional, each tile has 242 direct neighbors.<br>
			The mines are generated with a 5^n safty bubble around the player’s first click. The mines are
			generated randomly otherwise, with no guarantee that the board is logically solvable (without guesses) <br>
			Notice the indicator showing 30,000 mines generated on this playfield, making it unrealistic to fully solve anyway.
